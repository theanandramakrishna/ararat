# Privacy Policy for Crossword App

**Effective Date:** January 2, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how Crossword App ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Android application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Information
- **Google Account Information:** When you sign in with Google to use Google Drive features, we access your Google account email and basic profile information (e.g., name) through Google Sign-In. This is used solely to authenticate and authorize access to Google Drive for saving and loading crossword states.

### Usage Data
- **Crossword State Data:** The App allows you to save and load your crossword puzzle progress. This data includes the current state of the crossword (e.g., filled letters, hints used) and is stored locally on your device and optionally on your Google Drive in the app's private data folder.
- **Device Information:** We may collect anonymous device information such as device type, operating system version, and app usage statistics to improve the App's performance and functionality.

## How We Use Your Information

- **To Provide Services:** To save and load crossword states via Google Drive, ensuring your progress is preserved across sessions.
- **To Improve the App:** To analyze usage patterns and fix bugs, without identifying individual users.
- **Authentication:** To verify your identity for secure access to Google Drive features.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties, except as described below.

## Sharing Your Information

- **Google Drive:** Crossword state data saved to Google Drive is stored in your personal Google Drive account's app data folder, which is private and not accessible by us or other apps. Google may access this data as per their terms of service.
- **Third-Party Services:** The App integrates with Google APIs (e.g., Google Sign-In and Drive). Data shared with Google is governed by Google's Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## Data Retention

- Crossword state data is retained on your device and Google Drive until you delete it or uninstall the App.
- Google account information is not stored by us; it's handled directly by Google.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date."
